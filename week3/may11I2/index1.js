// we have a file which contains data
// we can import json or import fs
// we will learn fs import
// then we will do CRUD ops on it

// let a system has 20 files, each of these files is 10GB
// now we gotta process these files, the type of processing is sort all the files
// first challenge/assignment : we have to individually sort these files
// i.e. files d e f g are present in File1; a z d files are present in File2
// so sorting : b d e g in File1, and a d z in File2

// we can not do parallel sorting cz of system constraint, we have one system and it would require 200GB of memory to operate

// now make a COMBINED sorted file???
